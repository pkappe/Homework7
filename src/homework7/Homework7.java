/**
 * Every Walmart shopper receives a receipt for their purchases. Suppose weâ€™ve
 * been asked to write a Receipt class so their Java programmers have a new data
 * type to process their many receipts.
 *
 * Write this Java Receipt class for them. This class has methods to construct a
 * receipt from an input file, to calculate the sum of items from the file, to
 * calculate the 9% tax, and to calculate the total of the receipt.
 *
 * You must create 5 different input files with each file having a title line, a
 * date line, a unique receipt number, and exactly 3 lines of data. Each line of
 * data is a quantity (int), price (double), and a description (String).
 *
 * In your driver: Use your input files to test your Receipt class. You should
 * create 5 receipts, output them as a table, and then output the receipt number
 * of the maximum receipt total, the description of the largest priced item, and
 * the date of the item that was purchased the most. Duplicates are possible.
